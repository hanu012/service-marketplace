/**
 * Approve/Reject transitions for the vendor verification queue (SPEC
 * section 5.8) — pulled out of the Filament actions so the state transition
 * lives in one place regardless of which Action class triggers it (table
 * row vs page header).
 *
 * Each transition moves TWO states: the vendor's own lifecycle status, and
 * the account-level approval gate on the owning user (SPEC section 3.1).
 * They are deliberately driven from one place rather than left for an admin
 * to set twice — a vendor marked active whose user is still Pending can log
 * in and reach nothing, which reads as a broken app rather than a missed
 * click. Wrapped in a transaction for the same reason: half of that pair
 * applied is precisely the inconsistent state being avoided.
