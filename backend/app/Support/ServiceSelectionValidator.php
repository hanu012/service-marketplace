/**
 * The structural rules a category/subcategory/zone selection must satisfy,
 * shared by every place a vendor picks services (SPEC sections 6 and 3.3):
 * `StoreSubscriptionRequest` (initial subscribe) and
 * `AddSubscriptionItemsRequest` (adding within remaining quota, task 4.4).
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT include any quota-count check — that differs by
 * caller (absolute plan max at subscribe time vs. remaining quota when
 * adding later) and stays local to each Form Request. This class is only
 * the part proven identical between the two: a category must be active, a
 * subcategory must be active and belong to a category also being selected,
 * and a zone must be active and a leaf (SPEC section 8 — a zone with
 * children is navigation only, never itself a valid selection).
 *
 * Extracted rather than left duplicated so the two callers cannot silently
 * drift apart on what counts as a valid selection — see
 * ServiceSelectionValidatorTest for the drift-detection case covering both
 * endpoints at once.
