/**
 * Blocks the API until an admin has approved the account (SPEC section 3.1).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: registration now hands back a working token on purpose —
 * an unapproved user has to be able to sign in far enough to be *told* they
 * are waiting, and to sign out again. That token is otherwise fully
 * privileged, so the restriction has to be enforced here. A client-side
 * check alone would mean anyone calling the API directly, or any future
 * client that forgets, operates unapproved.
 *
 * Mirrors RequirePasswordChange deliberately: appended to the whole api
 * group rather than tagged per route, because a gate that only covers the
 * routes somebody remembered to mark is not a gate.
 *
 * Four things stay open. logout, because trapping someone in a session
 * they cannot leave is worse than the risk being managed. GET /user,
 * because the pending screen reads it to find out when the decision lands.
 * Device-token registration, so the push telling them they were approved
 * has somewhere to arrive. And DELETE /user — someone who decides not to
 * wait should not need our permission to leave.
 *
 * The allowlist is matched on method *and* path: `api/user` alone would
 * also have opened the DELETE, and later the PATCH on
 * `api/user/preferences`, by accident rather than by decision.
