 * target and the commission rate were all reachable only from the admin
 * panel — the app had no way to show a salesman their own record.
 *
 * `commission_rate_bps` is exposed as a percent string alongside the raw
 * basis points: the app should never do that division itself, because
 * rounding it differently from Salesman::commissionRatePercent() is how a
 * salesman ends up seeing a rate that disagrees with their payout.
