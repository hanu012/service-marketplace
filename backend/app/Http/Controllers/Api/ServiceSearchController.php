/**
 * Free-text service lookup for the customer's search bar (SPEC section 4
 * items 3-4).
 *
 * Searches subcategories, because that is the unit vendor matching
 * actually happens on — a customer typing "gas filling" wants the
 * vendors who do that specific thing, not everyone filed under AC
 * Service.
 *
 * Separate from /categories rather than a parameter on it: that endpoint
 * returns the whole tree as cache-on-launch master data and is
 * deliberately unpaginated, which is the opposite shape to a query that
 * returns a short ranked slice.
 *
 * Public, same reasoning as /categories — customers browse before
 * signing in.
