/**
 * A subscription plan (SPEC section 5.4).
 *
 * NOT DELETABLE THROUGH THE PANEL, but for a different reason than
 * categories/subcategories/zones. SPEC section 10 covers those three because
 * subscription_items.item_id carries no foreign key and a delete would orphan
 * rows. Plans are referenced by subscriptions.plan_id, which IS a real
 * foreign key with ON DELETE RESTRICT — the database already refuses. Offering
 * a delete action would therefore just surface a raw integrity-constraint
 * error to an admin.
 *
 * Deactivating is the removal path, exactly as for the other three, and the
 * effect is the same: existing subscriptions keep working, the plan stops
 * being offered.
 *
 * Price and duration are snapshotted onto each subscription at purchase, so
 * editing a plan never rewrites what past customers were charged.
