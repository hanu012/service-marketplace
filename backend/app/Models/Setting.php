 * hardcoding them — see the settings migration for the full documented key
 * list.
 *
 * RecordsAuditLog matters more here than on most models: SPEC section
 * 5.14 calls out audit logging as "especially important since salesmen
 * can grant free subscriptions," and free_trial_max_days /
 * free_grants_per_salesman_month are exactly the governance-sensitive
 * values that note is about. Only fires on a real Eloquent update() per
 * row — the settings admin page (task 6.7) deliberately never does a
 * mass query-builder update for this reason.
